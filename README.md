My critique on other maps was usually in terms of colour in context. I believe that lighter blue is better when zoomed in for water. I had some questions about adding a legend to my map, but I did not know how to do this. 




My reflective analysis:

  I am in Iceland right now. I started this map right before i flew out, and I designed this map for my mother. The markers i chose are the points I will be on my first day. The points are the airport, my hotel, the blue lagoon and the hospital in case of emergencies- I specifically included the hospital because of its proximity to my hotel to ease her worries. I kept the map fairly simple because there were few important points and my mom would not care about the rest. 
  
 I made several zoom features that would not be confusing to her. I made water featured darker before you approach them. I made some changes to the land feautres through zoom, where it would appear more green as you approach ( because Iceland IS green). I also wanted to add labels to my markers, but unfortunately all my points were grouped together and one label would apply to all, even though I wanted to label each marker individually.
  
  I returned to my work and realzied the points I added were in addition to the chicago points that I had forgotten to get rid of. I successfully removed them on mapbox, but my html file kept the chicago points and I do not understand where those points are coming from. There were a lot of hiccups with this and I think I could do a lot better on a second try, and make it a more easy to follow map for future Iceland visitors who want some hotspots to visit (plus the hospital). I would add more hillshade and terrain in a map that should be marketting Iceland. My goal with this was to keep it very simple and very easy for my mom to see.
